        "\n",
        "(1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Interpreted languages execute code line by line, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to gracefully handle errors and prevent program crashes, using try, except, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The finally block ensures code within it is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) What is logging in Python?\n",

        "(5) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The __del__ method is a destructor, called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing cleanup actions before memory is released.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Exception handling involves a try block for potentially risky code, except blocks to handle specific exceptions, and optionally a finally block for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Memory management is crucial for efficient resource utilization, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring program stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: try encloses code where exceptions might occur, and except blocks catch and handle specific exceptions, allowing the program to continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(15) How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Python's garbage collection system automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer in use, using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(16) What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The else block in exception handling executes only if no exceptions occurred in the try block, providing a path for code that should run when no errors are encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(18) What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: os.fork() creates a child process that is a copy of the parent, while multiprocessing creates new processes that are independent, with different memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(19) What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "(21) What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The logging module is used for recording program events, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages, to files, the console, or other destinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(22) What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file manipulation like creating, deleting, renaming, and checking file properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(23) What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Challenges in Python's memory management include potential memory leaks due to circular references and managing memory for large datasets, often addressed using techniques like weak references and generators.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(24) How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Exceptions are raised manually using the raise statement, followed by the exception type and optionally an error message, allowing for custom error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(25) Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Multithreading can improve responsiveness in applications with I/O-bound tasks, allowing parallel execution of code while waiting for external operations, like network requests or disk access.\n",
